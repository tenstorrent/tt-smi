# TT-SMI

Tenstorrent System Management Interface (TT-SMI) is a command line utility
to interact with all Tenstorrent devices on host.

Main objective of TT-SMI is to provide a simple and easy to use interface
to collect and display device, telemetry and firmware information.

In addition user can issue Grayskull board Tensix core reset.

## Official Repository

# Getting started
Build and editing instruction are as follows -

### Building from Git

Install and source rust for the luwen library
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### Optional
Generate and source a python environment.  This is useful not only to isolate
your environment, but potentially easier to debug and use.  This environment
can be shared if you want to use a single environment for all your Tenstorrent
tools

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```
### Required

Install tt-smi.
```
pip3 install .
```

### Optional - for TT-SMI developers

Generate and source a python3 environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pre-commit
```

For users who would like to edit the code without re-building, install SMI in editable mode.
```
pip install --editable .
```
Recommended: install the pre-commit hooks so there is auto formatting for all files on committing.
```
pre-commit install
```

# Usage

Command line arguments
```
tt-smi [-h] [-l] [-v] [-s] [-ls] [-f [snapshot filename]] [-g [GENERATE_RESET_JSON]] [-c]

  -g [GENERATE_RESET_JSON], --generate_reset_json [GENERATE_RESET_JSON]
                        Generate default reset json file that reset consumes. Default stored at
                        ~/.config/tenstorrent/reset_config.json. Update the generated file and use it as an input
                        for the --reset option
  -c, --compact         Run in compact mode, hiding the sidebar and other static elements
  -r [0,1 ... or config.json ...], --reset [0,1 ... or config.json ...]
                        Provide list of PCI index or a json file with reset configs. Find PCI index of board using
                        the -ls option. Generate a default reset json file with the -g option.
  --snapshot_no_tty     Force no-tty behavior in the snapshot to stdout
  -glx_reset, --galaxy_6u_trays_reset
                        Reset all the asics on the galaxy host.
  -glx_reset_auto, --galaxy_6u_trays_reset_auto
                        Reset all the asics on the galaxy host, but do auto retries upto 3 times if reset fails.
  -glx_reset_tray {1,2,3,4}
                        Reset a specific tray on the galaxy.
  --no_reinit           Don't detect devices post reset.
  ```

Some of these flags will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

## GUI
To bring up the tt-smi GUI run
```
$ tt-smi
```
This should bring up a display that looks as below.

![tt-smi](images/tt_smi.png)

This is the default mode where user can see device information, telemetry and firmware.

### Latest SW Versions
This section will display the software version of the device. If failures occur, error messages will show as below.

![tt-smi](images/error.png)

### App keyboard shortcuts
All app keyboard shortcuts can be found in the help menu that user can bring up by hitting "h" or clicking the "help" button on the footer.

## Resets

Another feature of tt-smi is performing resets on Blackhole, Wormhole and Grayskull PCIe cards, using the  ```-r/ --reset``` argument.

**WARNING for ARM systems.**
PCIe config is set up differently on those systems. Hence our current implementation of PCIe reset doesn't work as expected on them. It is recommended to reboot the system if you would like to perform a board reset on your ARM system.

```
$ tt-smi -r 0,1 ... or config.json, --reset 0,1 ... or config.json

    Provide list of PCI index or a json file with reset configs. Find PCI index of board using the -ls option. Generate a default reset json file with the -g option.
```

To perform the reset, either provide a list of comma separated values of the PCI index of the cards on the host, or an input reset_config.json file that can be generated using the ```-g/ --generate_reset_json``` command line argument.

TT-SMI will perform different types of resets depending on the device:
- Grayskull
  - Tensix level reset that will reset each Tensix cores.
- Wormhole
  - A board level reset will be perfomed. Power will be cut to the board and brought back up.
  - Post reset the ethernet connections will be re-trained.
- Blackhole
  - A board level reset will be perfomed. Power will be cut to the board and brought back up.

By default, the reset command will re-initialize the boards after reset. To disable this, update the json config file.


A successful reset on a system with both Wormhole and Grayskull should look something like the follows:

```
$ tt-smi -r 0,1

  Starting PCI link reset on WH devices at PCI indices: 1
  Finishing PCI link reset on WH devices at PCI indices: 1

  Starting Tensix reset on GS board at PCI index 0
  Lowering clks to safe value...
  Beginning reset sequence...
  Finishing reset sequence...
  Returning clks to original values...
  Finished Tensix reset on GS board at PCI index 0

  Re-initializing boards after reset....
 Done! Detected 3 boards on host.
```
OR
```
tt-smi -r reset_config.json

  Starting PCI link reset on WH devices at PCI indices: 1
  Finishing PCI link reset on WH devices at PCI indices: 1

  Starting Tensix reset on GS board at PCI index 0
  Lowering clks to safe value...
  Beginning reset sequence...
  Finishing reset sequence...
  Returning clks to original values...
  Finished Tensix reset on GS board at PCI index 0

  Re-initializing boards after reset....
  Done! Detected 3 boards on host.

```

In order to find the correct board dev id to call the reset on, the user can use the tt-smi board list function `tt-smi -ls` or `tt-smi --list`. The dev id listed is the same as found on `/dev/tenstorrent/<dev pci id>`
The generated output will include a list of all boards on host as well as the ones that can be reset.

```
$ tt-smi -ls

```
### Disabling SW version reporting

To disable the reporting of software versions and reporting of serial numbers, you can update the following parameters in the reset config file. The reset file can be generated into  ```~/.config/tenstorrent/reset_config.json``` using ``` tt-smi -g``` and then updated as follows :

```
    "disable_serial_report": false,     // make this true
    "disable_sw_version_report": false, // make this true
```

If the ```disable_sw_version_report``` is set to true, all the software versions in the ```Latest SW Versions``` block get reported as "N/A".

## Galaxy resets

There are two options available for resetting WH galaxy 6u trays.
  - glx_reset: resets the galaxy, informs users if there has been an eth failure
  - glx_reset_auto: resets the galaxy upto 3 times if eth failures are detected
  - glx_reset_tray <tray_num>: performs reset on one galaxy tray. Tray number has to be between 1-4

Full galaxy reset -
```
tt-smi -glx_reset
 Resetting WH Galaxy trays with reset command...
Executing command: sudo ipmitool raw 0x30 0x8B 0xF 0xFF 0x0 0xF
Waiting for 30 seconds: 30
Driver loaded
 Re-initializing boards after reset....

 Re-initialized 32 boards after reset. Exiting...
```
Tray reset -
```
tt-smi -glx_reset_tray 3 --no_reinit

```
To identify the correct tray number for resetting specific devices, users can run either `tt-smi -glx_list_tray_to_device` or `tt-smi --galaxy_6u_list_tray_to_device`. This command displays a mapping table that shows the relationship between tray numbers, tray bus IDs, and the corresponding PCI device IDs, making it easier to target the appropriate tray for reset operations. Note that this command should not be run in a virtual machine (VM) environment as it requires direct hardware access to the Galaxy system.

```
$ tt-sml -glx_list_tray_to_device

## Snapshots

TT-SMI provides an easy way to get all the information that is displayed on the GUI in a json file, using the ```-s, --snapshot``` argument. By default the file is named and stored as
``` ~/tt_smi/<timestamp>_snapshot.json```. User can also provide their own filename if desired, using the ```-f``` option.
If you don't want to pipe the output to a file, you can use ```tt-smi -f -```. It behaves like ```tt-smi -s```,printing snapshot info directly to STDOUT.

Example usage:
```
$ tt-smi -s -f tt_smi_example.json

    Gathering Information ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00
      Saved tt-smi log to: tt_smi_example.json
